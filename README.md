## üõ†Ô∏è Self-Hosting Guide

For optimal performance and privacy, you can self-host the addon. We offer multiple deployment options:

> [!TIP]  
> Consider adding custom/translated titles to custom-titles.json for enhanced functionality

### üê≥ Docker Compose Deployment

Deploy using Docker Compose for a containerized solution:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/pantelx/easynews-plus-plus.git && cd easynews-plus-plus
# Copy the .env.example file to .env
$ cp .env.example .env
# Start the container
$ docker-compose up -d
```

The docker-compose.yml file is configured to use the pre-built image by default, making it the easiest deployment option. To modify the configuration, edit the docker-compose.yml file before running `docker-compose up -d`.

Verify the installation by visiting `http://localhost:1337/` in your browser. To customize the port or other settings, edit the .env file before starting the container.

> [!NOTE]  
> The Docker image is automatically built and published to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) for each push to the main branch and for each new version tag. You can find all available tags on the [GitHub Packages page](https://github.com/pantelx/easynews-plus-plus/pkgs/container/easynews-plus-plus).

### üì¶ Source Installation

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Easynews?

Easynews is a premium Usenet provider offering a web-based Usenet browser. It enables users to search, preview, and download files from Usenet newsgroups without requiring a newsreader. Known for its user-friendly interface and fast download speeds, Easynews serves as an alternative to debrid services (Real-Debrid, Premiumize, AllDebrid, etc.). An active Easynews subscription is required to use this addon.

### How do I configure the addon server?

You can configure the addon server using environment variables:

1. **Port Configuration**: Change the default port (1337) by setting the `PORT` environment variable
2. **Logging Level**: Adjust the verbosity of logs with the `EASYNEWS_LOG_LEVEL` variable
   - Options: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `silly`, `silent`
   - Set to `debug` or `silly` for verbose logging during troubleshooting
   - Default: `info`
3. **Log Summarization**: Control debug log grouping with `EASYNEWS_SUMMARIZE_LOGS`
   - Set to `false` to see all individual debug logs (useful for detailed troubleshooting)
   - Set to `true` to group similar debug logs and reduce log volume
   - Default: `true` (enabled)
4. **API Search Configuration**:
   - `TOTAL_MAX_RESULTS`: Maximum total results to return
   - `MAX_PAGES`: Maximum number of pages to search
   - `MAX_RESULTS_PER_PAGE`: Maximum results per page
   - `CACHE_TTL`: Cache time-to-live in hours

The easiest way to configure these settings is by copying the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the project root.

For Docker deployments, the docker-compose.yml file is already configured to use the `.env` file automatically.

### How does the caching system work?

The addon implements a multi-level caching strategy to improve performance:

1. In-memory request caching reduces repeated API calls
2. Configurable Time-To-Live (TTL) ensures data freshness
3. Results are cached based on search parameters and user settings
4. Cached results are automatically invalidated after the TTL expires

This significantly reduces API usage and improves response times for frequently accessed content.

### How does title matching work?

The title matching system uses several advanced techniques:

1. Percentage-based similarity for multi-word titles
2. Support for various naming conventions (e.g., "The Movie" vs "Movie, The")
3. Special character handling (spaces, punctuation, accents)
4. Configurable strict matching option for exact results

When strict matching is enabled, only exact title matches are returned. When disabled, the addon uses smart matching to find related content. By default, strict matching is enabled.

### How does the custom title system work?

The custom title system helps find content with alternative titles or translations:

1. Original titles are combined with custom translations
2. Additional titles from metadata are incorporated
3. Partial matching enables finding related content
4. Self-hosted users can add custom titles via custom-titles.json

> [!NOTE]  
> To add custom titles to the public instance, please create a new issue with your suggestions.

### Why can't I find specific content?

First, verify the content exists on [Easynews web search](https://members.easynews.com/). If unavailable or returning poor quality results (duration < 5 minutes, marked as spam, no video), the addon won't find it either.

If the content exists on Easynews but the addon can't find it, this might be due to:

- Title matching issues between Easynews API and media player metadata
- Unconventional title formats
- Special character handling

Examples of challenging cases:

- Anime series like `death note` using non-standard episode numbering
- Movies with partial metadata matches (e.g., `Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One`)
- Special character handling (e.g., `WALL¬∑E` vs `WALL-E`)

For these cases, consider self-hosting and adding custom titles or using the public instance and create a new issue with the custom titles you want to get supported.

### How does the quality prioritization work?

The addon automatically prioritizes streams based on several factors:

1. Resolution quality (4K/UHD ‚Üí 1080p ‚Üí 720p ‚Üí 480p)
2. File size within the same resolution (larger files typically offer better quality)
3. Comparison of GB vs MB files (GB files are prioritized)
4. Numerical size comparison within the same unit (e.g., 2GB over 1GB)

This system ensures you get the highest quality content available without manual filtering.

### What sorting options are available?

The addon offers multiple sorting methods that can be selected in the configuration:

1. **Quality First** (default): Prioritizes by resolution quality, then preferred language, then file size.
2. **Language First**: Prioritizes content with your preferred language, then sorts by quality and size.
3. **Size First**: Sorts primarily by file size (largest first), then quality, then language.
4. **Date First**: Prioritizes newest content first, with secondary sorting by quality and language.

**All options use the same relevance-first API search, then sort results locally**

You can select your preferred sorting method in the addon configuration page. For optimal language prioritization, the "Language First" option works best when you've also set your preferred language.

### Why is there a 50-stream limit?

~~The addon limits results to the top 50 highest quality streams to:~~

~~1. Prevent media player overload~~
~~2. Optimize performance and response times~~
~~3. Focus on quality over quantity~~
~~4. Streamline the user experience~~

~~After quality sorting, the top 50 streams will represent the best available options, making additional results unnecessary.~~

This limit was removed in version 2.4.0.

### How does the language filter work?

The language filter allows you to prioritize content in your preferred audio language:

1. Select your preferred language in the addon configuration
2. Streams containing your preferred language audio will be shown first
3. Other language streams will be displayed below
4. All streams display their audio language information in the description
5. Your preferred language will be marked with a star (‚≠ê)

For maximum language prioritization effect, use the "Language First" sorting option in combination with your preferred language setting. This ensures content in your preferred language always appears at the top of results, regardless of quality or size.

This makes it easier to find content in languages you understand without removing other options.

If you need additional languages added to the public instance, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/pantelx/easynews-plus-plus/issues/new) with your request.

### How is platform compatibility ensured?

The addon achieves universal compatibility through:

1. Authentication implementation that works across all platforms
2. Direct media streaming without reliance on basic auth headers
3. Optimized response formats compatible with Stremio, Omni, Vidi and Fusion
4. Consistent stream URL structure that works uniformly across devices

This approach eliminates the platform-specific issues commonly found in other addons.
